The license for this branch is currently 'in flux'. Currently all the
changes from the branch on which this is based are Copyright (C) 2009-2010
Robin Watts for Pinknoise Productions Ltd, and can be used either under
license from Pinknoise Productions, or under the standard GNU GPL.

It is anticipated that this will change back to the simple BSD license
used by the original branch within a month or so, whereupon this
branch will be merged back to the trunk/branch it forked from.

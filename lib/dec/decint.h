/*Fix-ups for the libogg1 API, which returns -1 when there are insufficient
   bits left in the packet as the value read.
  This has two problems:
  a) Cannot distinguish between reading 32 1 bits and failing to have
   sufficient bits left in the packet.
  b) Returns values that are outside the range [0..(1<<nbits)-1], which can
   crash code that uses such values as indexes into arrays, etc.

  We solve the first problem by doing two reads and combining the results.
  We solve the second problem by masking out the result based on the sign bit
   of the return value.
  It's a little more work, but branchless, so it should not slow us down much.

  The libogg2 API does not have these problems, and the definitions of the
   functions below can be replaced by direct libogg2 calls.

  One issue remaining is that in libogg2, the return value and the number of
   bits parameters are swapped between the read and write functions.
  This can cause some confusion.
  We could fix that in our wrapper here, but then we would be swapped from the
   normal libogg2 calls, which could also cause confusion.
  For the moment we keep the libogg2 parameter ordering.*/

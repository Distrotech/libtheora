/*A node in the Huffman tree.
  Instead of storing every branching in the tree, subtrees can be collapsed
   into one node, with a table of size 1<<nbits pointing directly to its
   descedents nbits levels down.
  This allows more than one bit to be read at a time, and avoids following all
   the intermediate branches with next to no increased code complexity once
   the collapsed tree has been built.
  We do _not_ require that a subtree be complete to be collapsed, but instead
   store duplicate pointers in the table, and record the actual depth of the
   node below its parent.
  This tells us the number of bits to advance the stream after reaching it.*/
